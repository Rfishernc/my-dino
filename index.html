            <p>Born to a pair of travelling ventriloquists in the heartland of America, tragedy struck Rich Fisher early in life, losing his parents at the age of two in a freak snake handling accident.  Raised by coyotes till the age of 12, Rich's first contact with society would come as he was found scavenging the campsite of a traveling circus.  Life cleaning out the animal pins of the circus would prove difficult for the boy, but it was here that he discovered his astounding talent to perfectly mimic the sound of a digeridoo.  This lead to brief stardom for "The Digeridoo Whisperer" during the digeridoo craze of 1997, but his fortunes would prove short-lived, as a terrible Aspartame addiction would lead to financial ruin.  Under threat of tax evasion charges, Rich fled to Peru, where he took up life as a humble guinea pig rancher for the next ten years.  It was then in 2008 that he would be drafted into the little-known Peruvian-Jordanian War, but a clerical error would lead to him being declared a war hero before ever leaving.  His honor restored, Rich returned to the United States in 2012, founding the quickly growing health drink company, Pureed Green Stuff, which he runs till this day.   </p>
